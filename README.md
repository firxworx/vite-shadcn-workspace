# vite-shadcn-workspace

This repo houses an extensible pnpm [workspace](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) (monorepo) with [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). 

It can serve as a foundation for repositories with multiple applications that share common components and logic. TaiwindCSS is configured in a way that is ideal to serve as the foundation of a design system.

The [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli) is configured to manage components in `packages/react-ui` (`@workspace/react-ui`). Easily add new components to the workspace with a single command.

A fully functional React & Vite SPA with a starter "SaaS theme" in `apps/client` ties everything together in a deployable example.

[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [Syncpack](https://jamiemason.github.io/syncpack/) manage every aspect of the workspace; management frameworks such as Nx and turborepo are generally unnecessary however they can be easily added if desired.

100% TypeScript + ESM.

## Preview

## Features

### Tailwind Presets

The workspace includes two [tailwind presets](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/presets) for the ultimate in flexibility: `@workspace/tw-preset-shadcn` & `@workspace/tw-preset-workspace`.

The first preset effectively installs shadcn/ui per its docs and it can be used on its own. The second preset depends on the first and adds workspace-specific customizations. It includes the powerful [fluid-tailwind](https://fluid.tw/) plugin for _fluid responsive_ designs.

There are various advantages to using presets vs. sharing hardcoded tailwind configuration files because of how they can be shared and how TailwindCSS will intelligently merge multiple presets with a project config.

### UI Stack

The workspace leverages [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [fluid-tailwind](https://fluid.tw/) for styling with components from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) powered by [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/).

SPA routing is provided by [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/). It is fairly easy to swap with an alternative such as [@tanstack/router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) if required.

[Syncpack](https://jamiemason.github.io/syncpack/) helps ensure that dependency versions are in sync across the workspace.

[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) provides high-performance linting and formatting that absolutely crushes ESLint and Prettier.

`@workspace/react-ui` and the Tailwind presets are buildable with Vite and `tsup` respectively to provide a jump-start for design systems, custom component libraries, and/or publishing internal packages.

## Prerequisites

This workspace assumes `pnpm` and node are installed and that it is in a linux/unix environment. WSL2 is recommended for Windows users otherwise scripts may need to be reviewed and adjusted for compatibility.

Ensure `use-node-version` in `.npmrc` matches the node version you wish to use in this workspace.

Ensure that `apps/client/.env` exists (copy from `.env.example`).

## Development

Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Run an initial build:

```sh
pnpm build
```

Start the dev server at http://localhost:5173:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

The example React+Vite SPA is at `apps/client`.

The shadcn CLI is configured to manage components in `packages/react-ui` with package name: `@workspace/react-ui`.

## Maintenance

Use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to manage the workspace.

After installing or updating packages use syncpack to ensure consistent versions are used across the workspace:

```sh
pnpm syncpack list-mismatches
pnpm syncpack fix-mismatches
```

Run `pnpm dedupe` from time-to-time (dry run: `pnpm dedupe --check`).

## Using shadcn CLI

Run the following from the root of this workspace:

```sh
pnpm shadcn add [component]
```

The command executes the shadcn CLI in `packages/react-ui` and outputs to the package's `src/` directory per its config at `packages/react-ui/components.json`.

Substitute this command anywhere you see CLI installation commands in the [shadcn/ui docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).

For example `npx shadcn@latest add button` in the docs becomes `pnpm shadcn add button` in this workspace.

The `postshadcn` script target in the root `package.json` will be automatically triggered after the `shadcn` command runs. It will:

- run a script to fix the import paths of [node subpath imports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports) that the shadcn CLI unfortunately borks
- run biome to lint and format the generated files

**Do not be afraid of red console errors output by biome!** **Read it!**

Biome is able to automatically fix many issues however a decent percentage of components will still require your attention to fix. It is simply alerting you to what files you need to review.

**Always review every file generated by the shadcn CLI.**

Remember the whole point of shadcn/ui is to provide a _foundation_ of components for _you_ to _customize_ and _build on_.

Refer to the react-ui package [README](packages/react-ui/README.md) of the for more.

## Workspace Layout

The layout of this _workspace_ is designed to support multiple _projects_ (applications or packages) that share logic and components.

Per `pnpm-workspace.yaml` applications are under `apps/` and packages/libraries are under `packages/`.

Refer to the `package.json` of a given package for its `name`. This workspace follows the package naming convention: `@workspace/[package-name]`.

### Packages

Every package has its own `README.md`.

#### Shared Core

`packages/data` (`@workspace/data`) is an isomorphic (client _and_ server) package with only a peer dependency on `zod`.

It is intended to serve as a common dependency of other front-end or back-end applications and packages in the workspace. It does not contain any code that is dependent on either a browser or server-side/Node environment.

This package is the home "source of truth" for shared data, types/interfaces, [zod schemas](https://zod.dev/), and utilities to ensure data integrity and interoperability across the workspace.

#### React

React components are organized into separate packages:

- `packages/react-ui` core UI components package and the target for shadcn CLI (refer to its README)
- `packages/react-layout` reusable layout components (header, navigation, footer, etc)
- `packages/react-landing` reusable landing page components

The `react-ui` package has no internal depenencies other than `@workspace/data` and the internal TailwindCSS packages. It can serve as a common dependency of other `react-*` packages.

Tip: to keep the dependency graph simple and avoid circular dependencies: `react-*` packages should only depend on `react-ui`, and they should not depend on each other.

#### TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS configuration is managed via shareable [tailwind presets](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/presets):

- `packages/tw-preset-shadcn` (`@workspace/tw-preset-shadcn`)
- `packages/tw-preset-workspace` (`@workspace/tw-preset-workspace`)

`tw–preset-shadcn` implements the shadcn/ui [installation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/manual) and also exports a factory function `createShadcnPreset()` for additional flexibility.

`packages/tw-preset-workspace` is a workspace-wide preset that adds additional customizations including [fluid-tailwind](https://fluid.tw/). It includes the `tw-preset-shadcn` in its `presets` array.

The `cn()` style utility including `clsx()` and `tailwind-merge`configuration is housed in its own package:

- `packages/tailwind-style` 

This package stores `tailwind-merge` customizations and adds support for `fluid-tailwind` and any other additions to the standard tailwindcss library but may be added by a preset or plugin.

It is important to [customize `tailwind-merge`](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#usage-with-custom-tailwind-config) to support any non-default additions to tailwindcss. This key step is almost always overlooked by the vast majority of shadcn/ui projects and starters that use custom classes and configurations.

Run `pnpm build` and restart the dev server after making significant changes to the presets or `@workspace/style`.

## Motivation

Vercel spends a huge marketing budget to ensure there are countless examples and reams of LLM training data for NextJS + shadcn/ui.

There are comparatively few examples of Vite + React + shadcn/ui on GitHub and almost none are in a monorepo. 

With precious little training data to regurgitate, the LLM's of today are prone to hallucination and significant mistakes despite the immense popularity of this stack.

This workspace aims to provide an example for both human developers and LLM's.

Vite is a best-in-class build tool that serves as the backbone of many popular frameworks including Astro ❤️, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Qwik, Vike, Lit, and more.

The codebase is intended to be ready to serve as a foundation for your next project. It is complete enough to offer a working application that "flexes" the workspace while being simple enough to be easily understood and customized.

The shadcn/ui components used in the example application have minimal to no customization. The goal is to provide a meaningful head start without getting in the way.
