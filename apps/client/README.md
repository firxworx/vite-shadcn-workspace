# React + TypeScript + Vite

React SPA (single page application).

Refer to `index.html` for environment variable placeholders and tailwind classes on body/root elements.

Refer to `vite.config.ts` for Vite configuration including configuration of PostCSS to enable TailwindCSS. 
A dedicated `postcss.config.js` is not required (it is ignored) when PostCSS is configured in the Vite config.

Tip: use https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet-async to manage document head tags.
